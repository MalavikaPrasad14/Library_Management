                        I come from a country that was created at midnight. When I almost died it was just after midday.

                        When the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley in Pakistan, one girl spoke out. Malala
                        Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.

                        On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was
                        shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected
                        her to survive.

                        Instead, Malala's miraculous recovery has taken her on an extraordinary journey from a remote
                        valley in northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. At sixteen, she has
                        become a global symbol of peaceful protest and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

                        I Am Malala is the remarkable tale of a family uprooted by global terrorism, of the fight for
                        girls' education, of a father who, himself a school owner, championed and encouraged his
                        daughter to write and attend school, and of brave parents who have a fierce love for their
                        daughter in a society that prizes sons. </p>
